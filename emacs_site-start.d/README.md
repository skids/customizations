emacs site-start tweaks
========

My continuing battle with distro default settings which seem to
be intent on making emacs suck as hard as possible.

## 99-kill-crap.el

Kills inane electric indent mode and stupid integration between the
yank buffer and the X clipboard

## 99-only-morons-search-insensitively.el

Filename says it all

## 99-show-trailing-whitespace

Prevents emacs from auto-trimming whitespace off the ends of your
lines.  Shows trailing whitespace in red, so you can clean it up
yourself in those cases where you actually want to.
